## About The Project:

### Preview:

### üí≠Inspiration :

- The inspiration for our project, EvoQuire, stems from a deep-rooted belief in the transformative power of knowledge. Witnessing the gaps in legal education for children, we were motivated to create a solution that empowers young minds with an understanding of their rights. 
- The desire to bridge this educational divide and equip the next generation with essential legal insights served as the driving force behind EvoQuire. 
- Inspired by the potential to foster responsible and informed citizens, we embarked on a journey to make legal concepts accessible, engaging, and relevant to children aged 10 to 15. 
- Our project is guided by the vision of empowering young learners with the confidence to navigate the complexities of the legal world, ultimately contributing to a fair and just society.

### üí°What problem does the project solve?
- EvoQuire breaks down intricate legal concepts into kid-friendly explanations, making it easier for children to grasp their rights.
- Addressing the lack of age-appropriate legal education, EvoQuire provides an interactive platform tailored to children's needs.
- By educating children about their legal rights, EvoQuire empowers them to make informed decisions and navigate various situations confidently.
- EvoQuire serves as a bridge, helping parents and guardians facilitate discussions about legal rights effectively and strengthen family connections.

### üíÄ Challenges we ran into:
- Designing the UI using Figma was challenging as it was our first experience.
- Utilizing a database with Google Sheets and using it as an API was also a challenging task, since we have never used a database before.
- Incorporating slanted divisions and designing dialogue boxes posed challenges in the frontend development

### üîÆ What's Next For Our Project:
- Optimization and minor bug fixes
- Improve the question explanations
- Expand the database to contain more questions
- Add sound effects and animations
- User authentication
